Project 3 - Part 1a / 5
Video:  Chapter 2 Part 5
User-Defined Types

Create a branch named Part1

Purpose: The entire purpose of this 5-part project is to get you writing C++ code that compiles and to 
reinforce the syntax habits that C++ requires.  
What you create in this project will be used as the basis of Project 5 in the course.   

************************
Part1 purpose:  Learn to write UDTs

You are going to write 10 UDTs in project3.  
Part1 will be broken up into 5 separate steps, all on the same branch
    Part 1a: you will learn to think about an object in terms of its sub-objects.
    Part 1b: you will write 4 un-related UDTs in plain english
    Part 1c: you will write 1 UDT in plain english that will be made of 5 related sub-objects
    Part 1d: you will write plain-english UDTs for the 5 sub-objects that form the UDT defined in Part 1c
    Part 1e: you will convert those 10 plain-english UDTs into code that runs.
************************

1) Look at the picture of the car interior (Part1a pic.jpg).  
    Fill in the blanks below which break this car interior down into sub-objects.

    Several sub-objects are listed below that make up this car's interior.
        you're going to name several things that you'll find on each subobject
        you're going to name several things that each subobject can do.
        If you've seen "Family Feud", we are going to do what they do in that show

        A few blanks are filled in for you already.
